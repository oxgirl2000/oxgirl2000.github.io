Here are some things I've made:


[**BlazePoseOSC**](https://github.com/oxgr/BlazePoseOSC) - A desktop app that tracks bodies in 3D space and sends data out through OSC.

[**memor.io**](./works/memorio.html) - Online multiplayer experience where players simulate nodes in a distributed network.

[**Foresta-Inclusive**](./works/foresta.html)  
Ongoing collaboration with Jane Tingley as part of SLO Lab.

- [*Ongoing piece*](./works/foresta.html) - Historical sensor data attained over time depicted as tree rings.

[**Feathers of a Songbird**](./works/feathers-of-a-songbird.html) (Ongoing) - Custom wearable hardware toolset to wirelessly integrate digital control with fluid theatrical performance.

[**Melding Vistas**](./works/melding-vistas.html) - Interactive telematic performance. Dance collaborators tracked in realtime to affect audio visual output - all online.

[**Tactile**](https://soundcloud.com/faadhif/sets/tactile) - 3-track ambient/noise EP made when I felt like grasping for my life finally gave me haptic feedback.
