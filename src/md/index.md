Here are some things I've made:


[**BlazePoseOSC**](https://github.com/oxgr/BlazePoseOSC) - A standalone app that tracks bodies in 3D space and sends data out through OSC.

[**memor.io**](./works/memorio.html) - Online multiplayer experience where players simulate nodes in a distributed network.

[*Foresta-Inclusive*](https://janetingley.com/foresta-inclusive/)  
Ongoing collaboration with Jane Tingley as part of SLO Lab.
- [**CAFKA**](https://janetingley.com/cafka/) - A flowfield visualisation of environmental sensor data ported to p5.js.
- [**Ongoing piece**](./works/foresta.html) - Historical sensor data attained over time depicted as tree rings.

[**Feathers of a Songbird**](./works/feathers-of-a-songbird.html) (Ongoing) - Custom wearable hardware toolset to wirelessly integrate digital control with fluid theatrical performance.

[**Melding Vistas**](./works/melding-vistas.html) - Interactive audio/visual/dance performance with dancers tracked in realtime, all online.

[**Keyblade**](./works/keyblade.html) - Light- and movement-based sound controller. Definitely based on Kingdom Hearts.
